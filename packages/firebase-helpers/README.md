# @ttt-productions/firebase-helpers

Generic Firestore utilities (no Firebase initialization, no auth flows, no business logic).

## What’s inside
- Path helpers (collection/doc path builders)
- Timestamp/date helpers (serverTimestamp, conversions)
- Batch helpers (chunking, batched writes)
- Pagination helpers (cursor-based queries)
- Optional React Query-friendly helper (no hard coupling)
